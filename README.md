> Inspired by Steve Jones' remarks in his introduction to _The Emergence of the Digital Humanities_, DH students [Taylor Cate Brown](@taylorcate) and [Rebecca J. Parker](@RJP43) designed this graphic to expand on the idea that it is "along such complex boundaries, the multi-petalled borders of intersecting academic disciplines and practices, that the most interesting developments in methods and new questions emerge" (Jones 6). This iteration places a great deal of emphasis on Textual Studies as the root system—or origin—of this dynamic and evolving field of study. From there the body of a flower emerges, the petals emblazoned with the intersecting disciplines that make up the Digital Humanities. One leaf attaches itself to this system, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between DH and Textual Studies, boasting the term "Techuality" to bridge the conceptual divide between print culture and the network.
